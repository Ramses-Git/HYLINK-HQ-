I shouldn't share this file.
Heck, I shouldn't even have it.
But I need your help.
Please, look through this file and help me.
Use the password HLHQ_01.

[Dev Note:
This is an unfinished project and I'm working on making this an actual game. I'm planning it to make it Point-And-Click. More will be added in the future.
Stay Tuned.]

Currect Version: Prerelease 0.1.0.^

(P.S: You have to manually download and open the code file in your device's terminal. I don't know how to pre-implement that into GitHub yet, I'm very new to this.)
